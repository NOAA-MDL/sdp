1. Pay attention to your local emergency manager, particularly during an
evacuation.  DO NOT use the SLOSH Display program as an excuse to ignore your
local emergency manager!

The SLOSH Display program is only one of several tools used by emergency
management agencies to determine who is at risk and may be asked to evacuate.

2. We recommend people have some training.  We have some on:
http://slosh.nws.noaa.gov/sloshPub and we are developing additional training.

The key ideas to learn are:
   * What is storm surge?
   * There is inaccuracy in any model.
   * There is more inaccuracy in the input wind parameters to surge models
     than in the models themselves.
